<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>It turns out that <i>Calvin & Hobbes</i> and <i>Garfield</i> statistically have similar content. The top ten word categories for each comic are the same, and have generally the same percentage of occurrence</p>
<p>On top of that, it appears that <i>Garfield</i> is actually objectively more creative than <i>Calvin & Hobbes</i>. <i>Garfield's</i> content is 47% primary process, whereas <i>Calvin & Hobbes'</i> content is 44% primary process.</p>
<p>However, the differences in the result of content analysis were not statistically significant. From the results, we can conclude that both comics are actually similarly creative - from the perspective of naive content analysis.</p>
